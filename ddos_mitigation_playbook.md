# DDoS Mitigation Playbook

## Overview
This playbook helps SOC teams identify and mitigate DDoS attacks to protect critical systems.

## Step 1: Identification of DDoS Attack
- Monitor network traffic for large-scale traffic spikes.
- Identify the targeted services and affected systems.

## Step 2: Mitigation
- Engage with upstream ISPs or cloud providers for DDoS mitigation services.
- Use network filtering and rate limiting to block malicious traffic.
- Implement Cloudflare or similar WAF/DDoS protection services.

## Step 3: Analysis of Attack
- Identify the attack vector (e.g., SYN flood, DNS amplification).
- Analyze attacker patterns and devise strategies for future prevention.

## Step 4: Post-Incident Review
- Conduct a post-incident review and refine defenses.
- Update incident response plans and continue monitoring for future attacks.
