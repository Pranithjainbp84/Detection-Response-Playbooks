# Malware Analysis Playbook

## Overview
This playbook helps SOC teams analyze suspicious malware samples, containing threats and performing recovery actions.

## Step 1: Identification and Collection
- Collect the suspicious file from the affected system.
- Identify the file type and any associated IOCs.

## Step 2: Sandbox Analysis
- Run the sample in a secure, isolated environment to observe its behavior.
- Monitor file system, network activity, and registry changes during execution.

## Step 3: Containment
- Isolate affected systems.
- Block command-and-control servers or IP addresses.

## Step 4: Eradication
- Remove the malware using endpoint protection tools or manual methods.
- Verify that no traces of the malware remain in the system.

## Step 5: Recovery
- Restore systems from clean backups.
- Implement additional protection measures (e.g., updating antivirus, security patches).

## Step 6: Reporting
- Document the incident, actions taken, and lessons learned.
